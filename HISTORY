CHANGES: TR12734 GF project
1) GF-233 bug from release 91 testing fix punctuation at end of two description templates
2) GF-233 but from release 91 testing resolve 'raw' strain to MGI strain before 
     adding to sequence description
3) Update description templates with new wording per Carol
4) Update to use release 92 file - parse Ensembl from 'projection_parent_gene'
	and resolve to MGI marker, 4 new QC checks
5) update to use new '_primarymcvterm_key' from MRK_BiotypeMapping. Added to
   schema as _mcvterm_key is not what we want.
6) updated mgiconfig to release 92, and index.html
7) add J:262996 to B6 sequence description templates.
8) GF-286: 
    report and load following with marker assoc instead of skipping:
	Markers from input with > 1 Strain specific MGP ID
